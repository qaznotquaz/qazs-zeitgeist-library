        <p>hallowed halls, these once were. are? am? were?</p>

<p>i don’t think they’re meant to look like this. the clean-cut edges of the marble are shaven down, and the pieces barely fit together. the faces are not smooth or reflective, as they likely should be. instead, they are soft and gently rough.</p>

<p>i don’t think the pillars are supposed to be arranged on the floor, in pieces, like they are. the ceiling certainly stands, somehow, staying definitely sturdy amidst the strewn, useless structural supports. less lucky, however, is the floor.</p>

<p>pieces of it are broken apart - some having crumbled down into sinkholes, but many others having curiously fallen upwards, to cover up various faces and names engraved on the surfaces above my head. they’re beautifully carved, but most details have long since vanished.</p>

<p>i tried to read one. i found a path to the ceiling by way of clambering up broken chunks of marble, many of which float in place. once i placed my feet against the ceiling, i found it to be solid below me. i stood, cautiously, and surveyed the carvings. i made sure not to trample any out of respect for the dead, but i really don’t think they deserve it.</p>

        <p>the most legible bounded section i could find was still thoroughly weathered. all the others i saw nearby were shattered, covered, or missing large chunks, but this one was fairly intact. i knelt near the large, block characters at the top and silently brushed some dust away. the letters were as large as my chest, so i had to travel along the boundary a bit to clear all the dust away. by the time i looked back, though, the letters weren’t the same ones i was just looking at. the dust was still clear, but i couldn’t recognize these characters.</p>

<p>in fact, i can’t even describe them. i remember reading the text as ‘ΧΑΟΣ’ on my first pass, but that can’t be right. not logically, anyway. the text was much longer than that.</p>

<p>it doesn’t feel like there’s any incongruity, though. it’s not like i could comprehend whatever text replaced it every time i reasserted my attention.</p>

<p>after a few moments, i found myself walking into the room again. i don’t remember climbing back up to the floor, or falling from the ceiling, or seeing anyone else, or feeling any pain, i just-</p>

<p>i walked back in, and all the rubble i had climbed was now resting gently in a pile on the floor, save for one piece. it covered up half of the bounded section i was just reading.</p>

<p>these halls are- were- are? am? hallowed, in the name of nothing extant. they are here for nobody.</p>

<p>i guess that makes me nobody.</p>
