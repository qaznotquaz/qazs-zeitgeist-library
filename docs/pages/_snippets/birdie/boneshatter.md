- bones.

most people have them. but... when's the last time you thought 'wow, i'm really glad my bones are intact!'? when is the last time you thanked your bones for supporting you all the time? probably not recently, unless you'd perhaps broken one. 

i intend to fix that. with this extract, you'll never take your bones for granted again. it's not free, it's not easy, but it pays off well. it's my most ambitious project yet, though. and, since extracts really don't have to be liquid, i've decided to make this much more enjoyable to both prepare and ingest. in fact, i even found myself refactoring it all to use positive energy instead of the typical negative energy!

enjoy :)

***ingredients:***  

- **raw**  

*we'll use these to make some of the following ingredients, which are marked with an arrow*  
\- 1 coconut *(surprisingly instrumental)*  
\- 1 human skull *(obviously)*  
\- 1 cassowary egg *(if you'd like to get  a tougher egg from a magical beast be my guest)*
\- the last piece of white chalk in your lab teacher's room *(if you can't frustrate someone with loss by stealing their chalk, you'll have to antagonize the cassowary and that takes a lot more effort)*

- **wet**  

^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) coconut oil  
^ 1 tbsp whipped egg  
\- ca. 44 cm³ (3/16th cups) cane sugar *(color as close to bone as you can find)*  
\- ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) tallow butter  

- **dry**  

^ ca. 59 cm³ (1/4th cup) coconut flour  
^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/8th cup) bonemeal  
^ 1/8th tsp acid of chalk *(also leavening)*  
\- 1/4th tsp beeswing *(leavening)*  
\- dash of death's dust *(why do we have a fun name for this? it's literally just table salt)*  

---

***equipment: (please read the fucking equipment)***  
\- a bone sharpened to a skewer *(like, a femur or humerus or something - make sure it's tough)*  
\- a knife made from bone  
\- a firestarter

---

*yields one boneshatter extract in the form of half a dozen fluffy coconut cookies*

*a quick forewarning - you may want to read these steps through in advance before trying them at home.*

- **part 1:** shatter things :)

*step 1:*  
using the **sharpened bone** and your weak nerd arms, stab all the way through all three of the **coconut**'s eyes. *(fuck only stabbing the softest eye, we want carnage)*

*step 2:*  
pour out the coconut water and discard it or whatever, we're not going to be using it.

*step 3:*  
find the 'equator' of the **coconut** and, using the **skull**, bash it as violently as you can. gradually roll the coconut along this equator as you do this.

*step 4:*  
once the **coconut** splits, lay the resulting pieces white-face down and bash them with the **skull** as well to split them further. repeat this until you realize how much you enjoy the violence.

take a deep breath.

*step 5:*  
your workspace should be a mess by this point - that's good! find all the **smashed coconut meat** and gather it into a pile, and gather the **shattered pieces of the shell** into a separate pile.

*step 6:*  
if there's any **coconut meat** remaining on the **shell**, *gently* pry it off with your **bone knife**. you can relax while you do this and snack on some of the **coconut meat** you've already dislodged! we already have way more than we'll need. *(unless you'd like to make a massive batch - let me know how that goes! i barely have enough energy to make a dozen, so i really haven't been able to test huge batches)*

*step 7:*  
set aside your **coconut meat** for now - you'll need to carefully arrange your workspace for this next bit and can't have shit just lying around. prepare a bowl and put the **egg** in it, and set that to one side. on the other side, gather your **skull** and **bone tools** neatly on top of your **pile of coconut shell**.

*step 8:*
set the **coconut shell** beneath the bones alight and quickly place a hand on both the **egg** *(do not touch the bowl)* and the **skull**.

*step 9:*  
channel a rushing font of **positive energy** into the **skull** according to a variation on *[earth genasi name]'s tectonic fury* pattern. although we're giving it significantly smaller targets than normal, we don't want to reduce the source accordingly!

*step 10:*  
as the **bones** beneath your hand fracture and eventually disintegrate, make sure you hand stays in contact with the pile, even if *(or, especially if)* that means placing your hand directly against the **burning coconut**.

*step 11:*  
the first pile should reduce to powder fairly quickly, so be ready to channel any **excess positive energy** over to the **egg**. once the egg cracks you can remove your hand from the fire, but you only have until the eggshell is fully disintegrated to cease channeling. be attentive!

*step 12:*  
put out the fire *(if it hasn't already put itself out)*, set aside **bonemeal**, and discard **eggshell**.

- *preface*  
i made one dozen as a practice batch, but decided to let them spoil because they didn't come out as well as i'd hoped. after resting, i made a second batch that came out very cleanly - and, of course, one dozen cookies allows me two trials of casting this extract!

- *description*  
i brought a few friends (jakes, ████████, and therry) to my bed in the infirmary to spectate and spot me. *(they were each given a dozen non-magical coconut cookies for their troubles. or, at least, that was what was meant to happen)*
