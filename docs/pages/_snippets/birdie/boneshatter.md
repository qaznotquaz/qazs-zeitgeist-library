- bones.

most people have them. but... when's the last time you thought 'wow, i'm really glad my bones are intact!'? when is the last time you thanked your bones for supporting you all the time? probably not recently, unless you'd perhaps broken one. 

i intend to fix that. with this extract, you'll never take your bones for granted again. it's not free, it's not easy, but it pays off well. it's my most ambitious project yet, though. and, since extracts really don't have to be liquid, i've decided to make this much more enjoyable to both prepare and ingest. in fact, i even found myself refactoring it all to use positive energy instead of the typical negative energy!

enjoy :)

***ingredients:***

- **raw**

*we'll use these to make some of the following ingredients, which are marked with an arrow*  
\- one (1) entire coconut *(surprisingly instrumental)*  
\- 1 human skull *(obviously)*  
\- 1 cassowary egg *(if you'd like to get  a tougher egg from a magical beast be my guest)*
\- the last piece of white chalk in your lab teacher's room *(if you can't frustrate someone with loss by stealing their chalk, you'll have to antagonize the cassowary and that takes a lot more effort)*

- **wet**

^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) coconut oil  
^ 1 tbsp whipped egg  
\- ca. 44 cm³ (3/16th cups) cane sugar *(color as close to bone as you can find)*  
\- ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) tallow butter  

- **dry**

^ ca. 59 cm³ (1/4th cup) coconut flour  
^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/8th cup) bonemeal  
^ 1/8th tsp slaked lime *(also leavening)*  
\- 1/4th tsp beeswing *(leavening)*  
\- dash of death's dust *(why do we have a fun name for this? it's literally just table salt)*  

---

***equipment: (please read the fucking equipment)***  
\- a bone sharpened to a skewer *(like, a femur or humerus or something - make sure it's tough)*  
\- a knife made from bone  
\- a firestarter  
\- a clean, white rag  
\- slab of marble or similar *(we need a pan of unrefined mineral. the rougher, the better)*  
\- a smile :) *(no, really!)*

*yields one boneshatter extract in the form of half a dozen fluffy coconut cookies*

{% include collapsible.html title="steps" content="

*a quick forewarning - you may want to read these steps through in advance before trying them at home.*

- **part 1:** shatter things :)

***step 1:***  
using the **sharpened bone** and your <span class='underline'>weak nerd arms</span>, stab all the way through all three of the **coconut**'s eyes. *(fuck only stabbing the softest eye, we want carnage)* <span class='note'>Hah.</span>

***step 2:***  
pour out the coconut water but hold onto it - we'll be using that in the next part.

***step 3:***  
find the 'equator' of the **coconut** and, using the **skull**, bash it as violently as you can. gradually roll the coconut along this equator as you do this.

***step 4:***  
once the **coconut** splits, lay the resulting pieces white-face down and bash them with the **skull** as well to split them further. repeat this until you realize how much you enjoy the violence.

take a deep breath.

***step 5:***  
your workspace should be a mess by this point - that's good! find all the **smashed coconut meat** and gather it into a pile, and gather the **shattered pieces of the shell** into a separate pile.

***step 6:***  
if there's any **coconut meat** remaining on the **shell**, *gently* pry it off with your **bone knife**. you can relax while you do this and snack on some of the **coconut meat** you've already dislodged! we already have way more than we'll need. *(unless you'd like to make a massive batch - let me know how that goes! i barely have enough energy to make a dozen, so i really haven't been able to test huge batches)*

***step 7:***  
once you have all of your **coconut meat** separated out, continue using the **bone knife** and shred it into fairly small flakes. don't be too cautious here, *it's absolutely fine to bleed on these*. set aside the **coconut flakes** once you're done shredding them, we won't need them til the next part.

***step 8:***  
clear your work area! you'll need to carefully arrange things for this channel and can't have shit just lying around. prepare a bowl and put the **egg** in it, and set that in front of you. place the **stick of chalk** to one side. and, on the other side, gather your **skull** and **bone tools** neatly on top of your **pile of coconut shell**. 

***step 9:***
set the **coconut shell** beneath the bones alight and quickly place a hand on both the **chalk** and the **skull**.

***step 10:***  
channel a rushing font of **positive energy** into the **skull** according to a variation on *wolfram's tectonic fury* pattern. although we're giving it significantly smaller targets than normal, we don't want to reduce the source accordingly!

***step 11:***  
as the **bones** beneath your hand fracture and eventually disintegrate, make sure your hand stays in contact with the pile, even if *(or, especially if)* that means placing your hand directly against the **burning coconut**.

*listen closely to the sounds*

***step 12:***  
the **bone pile** should reduce to powder fairly quickly, so be ready to channel any **excess positive energy** over to the **chalk**. once the chalk starts to dissolve, quickly move your hand from the fire and place it on the **egg**.

*isn't the crackling pleasant?*
 
***step 13:***  
just like the last step, be ready to channel **excess positive energy** into the **egg** once the **chalk** fully dissolves. as soon as the egg cracks, cease channeling (lest ye be next). be attentive!

*what a satisfying* **crunch**

***step 14:***  
put out the fire *(if it hasn't already put itself out)*, set aside **bonemeal**, and discard **eggshell** *(if you want, you can add it to the chalk but again - we already have way more than we need here)*.

---

- **part 2:** coconut products

***step 15:***  
gather most of your **coconut flakes** *(leaving some, preferably bloodless, for decoration at the end)* into a container and soak them with the **coconut water**.

***step 16:***  
it doesn't concern me precisely what tool you use to do this, but next you need to blitz these **soaked flakes** as finely as you can. 

***step 17:***  
to this **blitzed coconut meat**, add the **chalk dust**. mix it up reasonably well.

***step 18:***  
gather that whole **mixture** together into your **rag** and hold it over a container. don't squeeze it or let too much drip until you've started channeling in the next step!

***step 19:***  
you'll be channeling **five parts positive energy** and **one part neutral energy** past the rag and into the **mixture** according to a pattern that is most similar to *lucy's purifying flame*. sorry, lucy, but i have to modify this one a lot.

all of your angles must be even sharper, which also means there will have to be more turns. hopefully, you will recognize some motifs in the resulting pattern from the *gemini bifurcation*, if you're familiar with that one. if you're not, just... make sure it's symmetrical, ok. *(if you are familiar but don't see what motifs you're supposed to recognize, you're certainly doing it wrong!)*

***step 20:***  
don't rush this channeling. enjoy the warmth, and gradually squeeze the liquid out - you should end up with pure **coconut oil** draining into the container below. enjoy the smell, too!

you'll know you can stop channeling when it starts getting uncomfortably hot. inside the rag, you should be left with a mixture of dry **coconut flour** and **slaked lime**. all the waste should already be discarded.

***step 21:***  
take a deep breath.

---

- **part 3:** baking!

***step 22:***  
we're going to take a few moments first here to sort out the rest of our ingredients.

[mix tallow, oil, sugar, and eggs]

[separately, mix flour, bonemeal, slaked lime, beeswing, salt]

[mix wet and dry]

[roll into balls, coat with flakes, put on slab]

[channel + to bake]

---

they should keep for a whole day as long as you don't break them up too much prematurely. you'll know they've expired if they're as stale as bone and in as many pieces as a smashed window.

enjoy :)

- *preface*  

i made dozen as a practice batch, but decided to let them spoil because they didn't come out as well as i'd hoped. after resting, i made two more dozen that came out very cleanly - and, of course, two dozen cookies allows me four trials of casting this extract!

- *description*  

i brought a few friends (jakes, <span class='scramble'>FRENDD</span> , and therry) to my bed in the infirmary to spectate and spot me. *(they were each given a dozen non-magical coconut cookies for their troubles. or, at least, that was what was meant to happen)*
