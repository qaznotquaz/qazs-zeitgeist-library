- bones.

most people have them. but... when's the last time you thought 'wow, i'm really glad my bones are intact!'? when is the last time you thanked your bones for supoprting you all the time? probably not recently, unless you'd perhaps broken one. 

i intend to fix that. with this extract, you'll never take your bones for granted again. it's not free, it's not easy, but it pays off well. it's my most ambitious project yet, though. and, since extracts really don't have to be liquid, i've decided to make this much more enjoyable to both prepare and ingest.

***ingredients:***  

- **raw**  

*we'll use these to make some of the following ingredients, which are marked with an arrow*  
\- 1 coconut *(surprisingly instrumental)*  
\- 1 human skull *(obviously)*  
\- 1 cassowary egg *(if you'd like to get  a tougher egg from a magical beast be my guest)*
\- the last piece of white chalk in your lab teacher's room *(if you can't frustrate someone with loss by stealing their chalk, you'll have to antagonize the cassowary and that takes a lot more effort)*

- **wet**  

^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) coconut oil  
^ 1 tbsp whipped egg  
\- ca. 44 cm³ (3/16th cups) cane sugar *(color as close to bone as you can find)*  
\- ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) tallow butter *(of a traumatized animal)*  

- **dry**  

^ ca. 59 cm³ (1/4th cup) coconut flour  
^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/8th cup) bonemeal  
^ 1/8th tsp acid of chalk *(also leavening)*  
\- 1/4th tsp beeswing *(leavening)*  
\- dash of death's salt *(why do we have a fun name for this? it's literally just table salt)*  

---

***equipment: (please read the fucking equipment)***  
\- a bone sharpened to a skewer *(like, a femur or humerus or something - make sure it's tough)*  
\- a knife made from bone

---

*yields one boneshatter extract in the form of half a dozen fluffy coconut cookies*

- **part 1:** shatter things :)

*step 1:*  
using the **sharpened bone** and your weak nerd arms, stab all the way through all three of the **coconut**'s eyes. *(fuck only stabbing the softest eye, we want carnage)*

*step 2:*  
pour out the coconut water and discard it or whatever, we're not going to be using it.

*step 3:*  
fine the 'equator' of the **coconut** and, using the **skull**, bash it as violently as you can. gradually roll the coconut along this equator as you do this.

*step 4:*  
once the **coconut** splits, lay the resulting pieces white-face down and bash them with the **skull** as well to split them further. repeat this until you realize how much you enjoy the violence.

take a deep breath.

*step 5:*  
your workspace should be a mess by this point - that's good! find all the **smashed coconut meat** and gather it into a pile, and gathered the **shattered pieces of the shell** into a separate pile.

*step 6:*  
if there's any **coconut meat** that remains on the **shell**, *gently* pry it off with your bone knife. you can relax while you do this and snack on some of the coconut meat you've already dislodged! we already have way more than we'll need *(unless you'd like to make a huge batch - let me know how that goes! it's exhausting enough for me to make as it is, so i haven't been able to test it)*
