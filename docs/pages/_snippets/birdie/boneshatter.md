- bones.

most people have them. but... when's the last time you thought 'wow, i'm really glad my bones are intact!'? when is the last time you thanked your bones for supporting you all the time? probably not recently, unless you'd perhaps broken one. 

i intend to fix that. with this extract, you'll never take your bones for granted again. it's not free, it's not easy, but it pays off well. it's my most ambitious project yet, though. and, since extracts really don't have to be liquid, i've decided to make this much more enjoyable to both prepare and ingest. in fact, i even found myself refactoring it all to use positive energy instead of the typical negative energy!<span class='note'>*</span>

enjoy :)

***ingredients:***

- **raw**

*we'll use these to make some of the following ingredients, which are marked with an arrow*  
\- one (1) entire coconut *(surprisingly instrumental)*  
\- 1 human skull *(obviously)*  
\- 1 cassowary egg *(if you'd like to get  a tougher egg from a magical beast be my guest)*  
\- the last piece of white chalk in your lab teacher's room *(if you can't frustrate someone with loss by stealing their chalk, you'll have to antagonize the cassowary and that takes a lot more effort)*  
<span class='note'>I was wondering where that went.  
+2 points for ingenuity.</span>  

- **wet**

^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) coconut oil  
^ 1 tbsp whipped egg  
\- ca. 44 cm³ (3/16th cups) cane sugar *(color as close to bone as you can find)*  
\- ca. 15 cm³ (1/16th cup) tallow butter  

- **dry**

^ ca. 59 cm³ (1/4th cup) coconut flour  
^ ca. 15 cm³ (1/8th cup) bonemeal  
^ 1/8th tsp slaked lime *(also leavening)*  
\- 1/4th tsp beeswing *(leavening)*  
\- dash of death's dust *(why do we have a fun name for this? it's literally just table salt)*  
<span class='note'>It is called Death’s Dust because death lurks within it, waiting to be torn free of its bonds. Also because some alchemists are pretentious and want their recipes to sound more dangerous than they are.  
+1 point for questioning the facts</span>  
  
  
<span class='note'>Volumetric measurements like these are impractical in the field. Consider revising with weight measurements instead.</span>

---

***equipment: (please read the fucking equipment)***  
\- a bone sharpened to a skewer *(like, a femur or humerus or something - make sure it's tough)*  
\- a knife made from bone  
\- a firestarter  
\- a clean, white rag  
\- slab of marble or similar *(we need a pan of unrefined mineral. the rougher, the better)*  
\- a smile :) *(no, really!)*

{% include collapsible.html title="steps" content="

*a quick forewarning - you may want to read these steps through in advance before trying them at home.*

- **part 1:** shatter things :)

***step 1:***  
using the **sharpened bone** and your <span class='underline'>weak nerd arms</span>, stab all the way through all three of the **coconut**'s eyes. *(fuck only stabbing the softest eye, we want carnage)* <span class='note'>Hah.</span>

***step 2:***  
pour out the coconut water but hold onto it - we'll be using that in the next part.

***step 3:***  
find the 'equator' of the **coconut** and, using the **skull**, bash it as violently as you can. gradually roll the coconut along this equator as you do this.

***step 4:***  
once the **coconut** splits, lay the resulting pieces white-face down and bash them with the **skull** as well to split them further. repeat this until you realize how much you enjoy the violence.

take a deep breath.

***step 5:***  
your workspace should be a mess by this point - that's good! find all the **smashed coconut meat** and gather it into a pile, and gather the **shattered pieces of the shell** into a separate pile.

***step 6:***  
if there's any **coconut meat** remaining on the **shell**, *gently* pry it off with your **bone knife**. you can relax while you do this and snack on some of the **coconut meat** you've already dislodged! we already have way more than we'll need. *(unless you'd like to make a massive batch - let me know how that goes! i barely have enough energy to make a dozen, so i really haven't been able to test huge batches)*

***step 7:***  
once you have all of your **coconut meat** separated out, continue using the **bone knife** and shred it into fairly small flakes. don't be too cautious here, *it's absolutely fine to bleed on these*. set aside the **coconut flakes** once you're done shredding them, we won't need them til the next part.  
<span class='note'>After experimentation, I have determined that it is mandatory for the Alchemist to bleed in this step. The wound primes the coconut flakes, allowing the Blood aspect to persist, even through the purifying channel of Steps 19-20. This aspect appears to provide a portion of the target for the casting, enabling the spell to affect living biological material.  
-5 points, failure to properly document a requirement.</span>

***step 8:***  
clear your work area! you'll need to carefully arrange things for this channel and can't have shit just lying around. prepare a bowl and put the **egg** in it, and set that in front of you. place the **stick of chalk** to one side. and, on the other side, gather your **skull** and **bone tools** neatly on top of your **pile of coconut shell**. 

***step 9:***
set the **coconut shell** beneath the bones alight and quickly place a hand on both the **chalk** and the **skull**.  
<span class='note'>I assume this is why you included a firestarter in your equipment list, though I would be shocked if any alchemist skilled enough to produce this extract could not light such a fire without resorting to outside help.</span>

***step 10:***  
channel a rushing font of **positive energy** into the **skull** according to a variation on *wolfram's tectonic fury* pattern. although we're giving it significantly smaller targets than normal, we don't want to reduce the source accordingly!

***step 11:***  
as the **bones** beneath your hand fracture and eventually disintegrate, make sure your hand stays in contact with the pile, even if *(or, especially if)* that means placing your hand directly against the **burning coconut**.

*listen closely to the sounds~*<span class='note'>\**</span>

***step 12:***  
the **bone pile** should reduce to powder fairly quickly, so be ready to channel any **excess positive energy** over to the **chalk**. once the chalk starts to dissolve, quickly move your hand from the fire and place it on the **egg**.

*isn't the crackling pleasant?*<span class='note'>\**</span>
 
***step 13:***  
just like the last step, be ready to channel **excess positive energy** into the **egg** once the **chalk** fully dissolves. as soon as the egg cracks, cease channeling (lest ye be next). be attentive!

*what a satisfying* **crunch.**<span class='note'>\**</span>  
  
<span class='note'>** In general, I would not recommend advising alchemists to divide their focus, especially not whilst channeling Wolfram's. As I'm sure you know, losing focus with Wolfram's can have unpleasant side-effects.</span>

***step 14:***  
put out the fire *(if it hasn't already put itself out)*, set aside **bonemeal**, and discard **eggshell** *(if you want, you can add it to the chalk but again - we already have way more than we need here)*.

---

- **part 2:** coconut products

***step 15:***  
gather most of your **coconut flakes** *(leaving some, preferably bloodless, for decoration at the end)* into a container and soak them with the **coconut water**.

***step 16:***  
it doesn't concern me precisely what tool you use to do this, but next you need to blitz these **soaked flakes** as finely as you can. 

***step 17:***  
to this **blitzed coconut meat**, add the **chalk dust**. mix it up reasonably well.

***step 18:***  
gather that whole **mixture** together into your **rag** and hold it over a container. don't squeeze it or let too much drip until you've started channeling in the next step!

***step 19:***  
you'll be channeling **five parts positive energy** and **one part neutral energy** past the rag and into the **mixture** according to a pattern that is most similar to *lucy's purifying flame*. sorry, lucy, but i have to modify this one a lot.

all of your angles must be even sharper, which also means there will have to be more turns. hopefully, you will recognize some motifs in the resulting pattern from the *gemini bifurcation*, if you're familiar with that one. if you're not, just... make sure it's symmetrical, ok. *(if you are familiar but don't see what motifs you're supposed to recognize, you're certainly doing it wrong!)*  
<span class='note'>It would have probably been easier for you to design a channel from scratch to do this, but I'm glad you appreciate the classics.</span>

***step 20:***  
don't rush this channeling. enjoy the warmth, and gradually squeeze the liquid out - you should end up with pure **coconut oil** draining into the container below. enjoy the smell, too!

you'll know you can stop channeling when it starts getting uncomfortably hot. inside the rag, you should be left with a mixture of dry **coconut flour** and **slaked lime**. all the waste should already be discarded.

***step 21:***  
take a deep breath.

---

- **part 3:** baking!

***step 22:***  
we're going to take a few moments first here to sort out the rest of our ingredients. take the **dry mixture** you've just obtained and, with a sifter *(or whatever your preferred method of separating powders is),* separate the **coconut flour** from the **slaked lime**. set these aside.

***step 23:***  
wet ingredients! mix **tallow** and **sugar** together until smooth. once they are, beat in **coconut oil** and **cassowary egg** *(the whites and yolk, not the shell - got that backwards one time. don't do that, they don't come out well),* also until smooth. if you want, try a taste! no really, do go on.

smile.

***step 24:***  
dry ingredients! mix **coconut flour**, **bonemeal**, **slaked lime**, **beeswing**, and **salt** together thoroughly. make sure you measure the proportions right, this is why we made them separate in the first place! you can get a little more aggressive here - powders are a lot less cooperative with being evenly mixed.

***step 25:***  
gradually add the **dry** ingredients to the **wet**, incorporating everything together neatly. when you're done, you should have a decently smooth, bone-white **dough**. *(you have GOT to try a taste of the dough here - it's delicious, and this is the last chance you'll have to do so safely)*  
<span class='note'>I'm certain the dough would be delicious, to someone with any affinity for coconut. Alas, I am not such a someone.</span>

***step 26:***  
get out your **coconut flakes** and your **mineral slab**. divide the **dough** into six little balls, roll each of them in the **flakes** to coat them, and arrange them on the **slab**.

***step 27:***  
time for the third *(and final)* preparation channel. you've been enjoying this so far, right? i sure hope so! you're going to be channeling an **unrestricted amount of positive energy** into the **slab** according to another modified pattern. it's based on *gorkchuk's basic kiln*, but we're replacing all of its safety measures with the main motifs from *snaps's instant*.

obviously, things are going to get a little hot. *bask* in the *gentle wave of heat* as it washes over you, but maintain the channel into the **slab**. smile *giddily* and laugh - think of the *thrill*, the *rush*. your hands might *burn*, wouldn't that be ***nice?*** if your sleeves are touching the slab, *they may already be on fire*. exciting!

***step 28:***  
as soon as you realize you may have burnt the **cookies**, stop channeling and put out any residual fires. the **cookies** will have come out *just right!*

---

they should keep for a whole day as long as you don't break them up too much prematurely. you'll know they've expired if they're as stale as bone and in as many pieces as a smashed window.

enjoy :)

{% include collapsible.html title="serving instructions" content="
the first thing to remember about this is that eating cookies is always meant to be an enjoyable experience. these are no exception, despite what you may figure from their magical properties! when you eat them, make sure *not to get into a rhythm* or anything. maybe eat a few all at once and then the others with a few seconds between, or perhaps just shove them all in your face and try to swallow it without choking? however you do it, have fun! *revel* in the crunch they make in your mouth, the mess of crumbs scattering aimlessly, the chalky white powder staining your clothes. you'll be using *wolfram's tectonic fury* again, with an **unrestricted amount of positive energy**. don't worry about the source or the target, they'll sort themselves out. make other modifications if you would enjoy doing so.

make sure to get through the entire batch! normally, you would want to stop channeling *before* hurting yourself, but here? stop whenever the hell you want. it'll hurt no matter what, but why come all this way only to skimp on the most important step? go all out! have some fun, scare some people with your screams, show them the *bone fragments* sticking out of your skin! laugh in *revelrous bliss*, cry in *cathartic horror*, *let it all out*. have a grand old time.

if you're infusing, this step will still leave you sore despite the fact that your bones are fine.  
  
<span class='note'>As a note, do *not* attempt to cast this while under any form of pain reducing effect. Passing out from the pain and releasing all of that positive energy is the only reason the caster is able to survive this extract.</span>

enjoy!

- *preface*  

i made one dozen as a practice batch, but decided to let them spoil because they didn't come out as well as i'd hoped<span class='note'>***</span>. after resting, i made two-and-a-half more dozen that came out very cleanly - and, of course, that many cookies allows me five trials of casting this extract!

i infused one dozen, out of an interest in noting the differences in infused and non-infused casting of this spell. my results were not as i expected, but they *were* enlightening.
  
<span class='note'>*** I assume you are referring to the batch you made with the shell of the cassowary egg instead of the yolk and white. I am curious about how that would have turned out.</span>

- *description*

i brought a few friends (jakes, <span class='scramble'>FRENDD</span> , therry and <span class='headache'>someone</span>) to my bed in the infirmary to spectate and spot me. *(i made four dozen batches of  non-magical coconut cookies - one for each of them - for their troubles. or, at least... that was what was meant to happen)*

---

# intended trials

- *first trial*

the first trial went nominally. it was a control - imbibing- er, consuming and channeling normally. i heard cracks developing underneath my skin after the first few bites, and i began to feel them expanding as i started in on the second cookie. my arms were a bit difficult to use once the bones began to properly fragment, but i managed to get the rest of the cookies into my mouth before crumpling into a heap. the pain has left the remaining memories in somewhat of a haze, but i remember it fondly. i only stopped channeling when i passed out.

attached are some sketches therry did while i recovered. they tried to piece together every bone fragment they could find - notice how nothing quite fits together like it should? the bones didn't break like bones normally break. they broke because they *grew* unevenly. just like you can shatter metal by deforming it unevenly, so too can we shatter bones with *healing magic*.  
  
<span class='note'>+3 points, the attached sketches were most illuminating.</span>

---

- *second trial*

i woke up maybe an hour or so later. after enduring the pain of re-assembly, i barely waited for the nurse to leave before shoving the entire second batch into my mouth. now, here's the important thing about this - *it went badly*. this is the trial where everybody realized something had gone wrong all at once. i began to channel just the same as i did for the last batch, but... well. this wasn't an extract. unbounded positive energy flowed directly through me with no guidance, and i won't deny - it was elating! my bones felt fine, though, and i began to develop dry cracks in my skin and an absolutely *killer* headache, among other expected symptoms of raw channeling.

someone shouted 'shit, help!', i think, and the nurse came straight back in.
  
<span class='note'>-2 points, failure to properly inspect implements before channeling.</span>

---

- *note*

while i was recovering after the first trial, by the way, my friends all began to eat some of their reward cookies a little early. they quite enjoyed the taste! they continued eating them and each happened to finish their cookies about the same time as my second trial. for what it's worth, it was certainly an experience to remember!  
  
<span class='note'>As much as I appreciate your rigorous approach to research, I am required by University policy to remove points for injuring unintended subjects, based on the severity of their injuries.</span>

# accidental trials

- *trial alpha*

jakes was the next to pop. really, much the same as i did in my control trial! must've gotten an infusion. he recalls similarly little of it, but he also has the highest pain tolerance of all of us so i really think he got the long end of the stick here, what with the 'joy' part of the juice. er, cookie. extract- you know what i mean. i think i secreted an entire femur's worth of his bone fragments into my bag amongst the chaos.
  
<span class='note'>-2 points, Critical Physical Injuries to Bystander<br><s>-1 point, Unsanctioned requisition of bone matter from living subject.</s> Subject apparently provided consent for this requisition in advance.</span>

---

- *trial beta*

therry didn't show any outward effects, but they apparently experienced a distinctly uncomfortable sensation. i'd wager they ate an entire extract but, of course, never cast it. below i've copied what they said about it when i interviewed them more the next day:

\"*You're an asshole, first of all! You're a moron, why did you even let that mixup happen? It's some wonder that <span class='scramble'>FRENDD</span> is still okay after all that, not to mention- ah right, the question.*

*For a good several seconds, I just thought it was nausea - I've never been queasy around gore before, but I've also never watched... and heard... someone break all their bones at once before. Then I thought it was a panic attack. I wish it was a panic attack. It's like someone was wrenching their hand through my soul. It was this... painless, disgusting sensation that was expecting to be filled. It stayed there, twisting and turning, for like ten minutes or something. I retched twice, or at least I thought I did - apparently I looked just fine to you lot.*

*Somehow, I didn't even notice it leave.*\"
  
<span class='note'>+2 points, the inclusion of the subject interview was very wise of you. Sometimes the best sources of information are the test subjects themselves.  
-0.5 points, Short-Term spiritual injuries to bystander</span>

---

- *trial gamma*

<span class='scramble'>FRENDD</span> botched an attempt at fixing the situation. i think he was the one who called for assistance, but not before trying to completely dispel the obvious immediate effects on myself, jakes, and <span class='headache'>someone</span>. instead, i think he dispelled his own bones. it's not really clear, but he certainly did end up in a loose pile on the floor. he hadn't yet realized he'd already eaten a full extract, methinks, and the extract redirected that spell in all the wrong ways. obviously, he made a full physical recovery fairly quickly - didn't even miss class the next day, as you should recall - but, the effects on his soul haven't been so simple. since, he has managed to set his bones on fire, fortify them as though steel, banish them, and even perform augury with them, all without removing any of them. uh, his bones are also the *only* thing that he can direct spells towards. today should mark the tenth day since, with no apparent changes.

i don't think i'll be doing any experiments with <span class='scramble'>FRENDD</span>'s help again for... quite some time.  
  
<span class='note'>-3 points, Critical Physical Injuries, and Medium-Term spiritual injuries to bystander.</span>

<ul><li class='note'>Report</li></ul>

<span class='note'>I am genuinely impressed by your work here. When I first read the title on this report I was worried that you had found an original formulation of the spell somewhere, and replicated it. I would not have been surprised if you somehow had found a spell pattern for it tucked away in some dusty tome in the Library, despite the fact that it has been banned essentially anywhere that civilization has advanced enough to have laws. Having experienced the effects of both the original and your new formulation, I can conclude that your formulation of the spell achieves similar effect to the original. This alone would have been enough to complete the requirements of the assignment, but you redesigned the entire spell to use Positive Energy, shattering bone with targeted healing. This ludicrous ingenuity is exactly what I have come to expect from your assignments, and I was pleased to see it here, in your final assignment as a student with our University.</span>

<span class='note'>My own opinions aside, I found your report to be extremely well-prepared. As usual, your capitalization is sorely lacking, but I've given up taking points off for it. The instructions you provided for preparing the extract were a breeze to follow (no pun intended). As I mentioned in my notes on your process, I had to make a second attempt at preparing your extract, which meant I had to steal chalk twice. Xvim was not happy. Other than that setback, your instructions were easy to follow, and I found myself enjoying the process, up until it came time to experience my handiwork. That was, as expected, agony. Overall, masterful work.</span>

<span class='note'>I appreciate the candor and accuracy you held to in your summary of events, even if they were not the results that were originally intended. Your commitment to the pursuit of knowledge amazes me. A lesser alchemist may not even have documented such failures, but you went above and beyond merely documenting them, capturing as many details as you possibly could, including taking samples of bone matter for later study. While I am required by University policy to discourage you from performing testing on living subjects, I approve of your rigorous approach to understanding even the most severe of failures, despite what I'm sure was substantial physical and emotional trauma. I look forward to working with you on our research, instead of grading your assignments. You have a bright future ahead of you at this University, birdie.</span>
