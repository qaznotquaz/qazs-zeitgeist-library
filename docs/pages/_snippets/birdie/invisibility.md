[DESCRIPTION NEEDED]

{% include collapsible.html title="you will need:" content="
***ingredients:***  
\- 1 cup octopus ink *(sorry about the taste)*  
\- at least 4 cups weak wine, beer, or similar *(has nothing to do with the magic - we just need to make this drinkable!)*  
\- 1 tbsp bone char powder *(this is why we can't use water for that, though)*  
\- 1 tbsp fernseed *(i don't know what this is)*  
\- enough liquid resin to insulate and encapsulate the solid ingredients *(should be less than 2/3 cups)*  
\- at least 2 eyelashes *(you'll lose one)*  
\- 2\" square ripped piece of a used cloak *(i actually laughed out loud when i read about this. make sure the cloak has actually been used before)*  
\- 1 eye of a cat, dog, hare, deer, or similar beast *(couldn't find any way around it)*  
\- 1 small crystal ball, triangular prism, or other clear refractor  
\- 1 tbsp glamer glitter *(any brand will do. you can also shatter and grind the glass yourself, which is what i did because i forgot to buy any!)*  
\- 2/3 cup dark chocolate morsels *(functionally, you only need, like, one and a half tablespoons? but this is literally the only thing in here that tastes good, so)*  
\- 1 tsp mint extract *(for taste)*  
\- darkness and a really good sense of your space. the less you look at this as you're making it, the better.

---

***equipment:***  
\- most people are going to skip this anyways  
\- if you're confident, a blindfold  
\- a rag  
\- two extra bottles *(only one if you already have glamer glitter)*

---

yields one and a half invisibility extracts. *teach, why does it make this much?*

{% include collapsible.html title="steps" content="

*step 1:*  
suspend eye, eyelashes, cloak, and refractor in resin. if you have time to cure this, leave it covered in a dark room to do so and complete this extract when it's cured. if not... the extract will still *work*, but i cannot promise it will be comfortable.

*step 2:*  
begin melting dark chocolate.

*step 3: (skip this step if you already have glamer glitter.)*  
using the rag, take a boulder-marble-sized piece of broken glass and break it into smaller and smaller pieces.
grind these pieces finely. in case you ignore the warnings on this stuff, by the way? don't touch it!

*step 4:*  
stir bone char, fernseed, and glitter into ink.

*step 5:*  
coat resin with dark chocolate like it's candy.

*step 6:*  
place resin-chocolate-ball into the target bottle, then add ink solution. fill remaining space with alcohol.

*step 7:*  
shake well and wait a few moments - the resin-chocolate-ball should disappear. at this point, add the mint extract and fill any remaining space with more alcohol.

corked and left out of direct line of sight, this should last indefinitely. it will never taste good.  
shake well before serving.

<span class='reread'>wait, i learned this spell back in college? in the ***intro*** class?? they took way more from me than i thought.  
how...</span>

<span class='reread'>how do you un-learn a spell? i guess i'm glad i.. remembered..? it? why do i even have this in my bag? it's not like i need to use it, i've already re-learned this on my own.</span>

<span class='reread'>... i can't believe i forgot about sand. sand! dr mayakovski probably only knew to mark me for attendance from seeing the blood dripping blood from my hand after grabbing a handful of diy \"glitter\".</span>
