as you're likely aware, last semester, i broke into the reagents storage room. i had an idea and nothing was stopping me - i'd thought through everything that might go wrong and planned my whole heist like two days in advance. given that you're likely aware of this, though, it's pretty clear i messed up somewhere. i got caught! i was seen, by another student *who was doing the same thing!* injustice aside, i would have loved to have had a way to just disappear for a little while. we could all use a break sometimes, yeah?

well, that's what **invisibility** is for!

***ingredients:***  
\- 1 cup octopus ink *(sorry about the taste)*  
\- at least 4 cups weak wine, beer, or similar *(has nothing to do with the magic - we just need to make this drinkable! i used some blackberry boxed wine, but it really doesn't matter so long as it's alcoholic)*  
\- 1 tbsp bone char powder *(this is why we need alcohol, though)*  
\- 1 tbsp fernseed *(i don't know what this is)*  
\- enough liquid resin to insulate and encapsulate the solid ingredients *(should be less than 2/3 cups)*  
\- at least 2 eyelashes *(you'll lose one)*  
\- 2\" square ripped piece of a used cloak *(i actually laughed out loud when i read about this. <span class='underline'>make sure the cloak has actually been used before</span>)* <span class='note'> I like to sneak around in the cloak that I use - it seems to add a small sound dampening effect. Not much, but every little bit helps!</span>  
\- 1 eye of a cat, dog, hare, deer, or similar beast *(couldn't find any way around it)*  
\- 1 small crystal ball, triangular prism, or other clear refractor  
\- 1 tbsp glamer glitter *(any brand will do. you can also shatter and grind the glass yourself, which is what i did because i forgot to buy any!)*  
\- 2/3 cup dark chocolate morsels *(functionally, you only need, like, one and a half tablespoons? but this is literally the only thing in here that tastes good, so)*  
\- 1 tsp mint extract *(for taste)*  
\- darkness and a really good sense of your space. the less you look at this as you're making it, the better.

---

***equipment:***  
\- most people are going to skip this anyways  
\- if you're confident, a blindfold  
\- a rag  
\- two extra bottles *(only one if you already have glamer glitter)*

---

yields one and a half invisibility extracts. *teach, why does it make this much?*

{% include collapsible.html title="steps" content="

*step 1:*  
suspend eye, eyelashes, cloak, and refractor in resin. if you have time to cure this, leave it covered in a dark room to do so and complete this extract when it's cured. if not... the extract will still *work*, but i cannot promise it will be comfortable.

*step 2:*  
begin melting dark chocolate.

*step 3: (skip this step if you already have glamer glitter.)*  
using the rag, take a boulder-marble-sized piece of broken glass and break it into smaller and smaller pieces.
grind these pieces finely. <span class='underline'>in case you ignore the warnings on this stuff, by the way? don't touch it!</span> <span class='note'>I trust that you learned why firsthand?</span>

*step 4:*  
stir bone char, fernseed, and glitter into ink.

*step 5:*  
coat resin with dark chocolate like it's candy.

*step 6:*  
place resin-chocolate-ball into the target bottle, then add ink solution. fill remaining space with alcohol.

*step 7:*  
shake well and channel neutral energy through the bottle until the resin-chocolate-ball completely disperses.

*step 8:*  
add the mint extract and fill any remaining space with more alcohol.

corked and left out of direct line of sight, this should last the full day an extract should last before becoming inert. it will never taste good.
" %}

{% include collapsible.html title="serving instructions" content="
shake well before serving. make sure not to look at the extract before or while drinking it. to keep your mind off the briny flavor *(and to not injure yourself!)*, channel **neutral energy** according to **lukas' emptiness**. don't rush it. don't fall asleep. the sooner you forget what you look like, the less draining this is going to be. you'll be fine from there. though, *stop channeling* if you forget what eye contact looks like, or what your name sounds like. no telling what your eyesight will be like if the extract runs its course while you're still channeling.

enjoy!

<span class='note'>You do realize this was meant to be a theoretical exercise, yes? Not a practical one? Frankly, I'm impressed you were able to both make and use this extract. I'd like to talk to you about that after class. In the future, though, be more careful when crushing glass. Or, of course, you can always use sand as a weak glamer glitter in a pinch. Either way, we wouldnâ€™t want your invisibility ruined by blood splatter again, would we?

<span class='note'>As for your query about the yield: your wine was actually an active ingredient! Well, more specifically the blackberry in it. You may have meant it to be cheap and inert, but the wine you chose was extremely effective.

<span class='note'>Moving forward, we would all appreciate it if you used correct capitalization and formatting. And, of course, proper precaution. These are the only two points I can mark off of this assignment, though - well done!

<span class='underline note'>Grade: 98%

<span class='note'>P.S., I still keep the product of your little heist on my desk, it's a very interesting pet rock and door knocker.

<span class='reread'>wait, i learned this spell back in college? in the ***intro*** class?? they took way more from me than i thought.  
how...

<span class='reread'>how do you un-learn a spell? i guess i'm glad i.. remembered..? it? why do i even have this in my bag? it's not like i need to use it, i've already re-learned this on my own.

<span class='reread'>on another note, are they talking about my first thunderstone? i forgot that thing even existed! i thought it barely even worked, but i guess it was worth holding onto?

<span class='reread'>...i can't believe i forgot about sand. sand! dr mayakovski probably only knew to mark me for attendance from seeing the blood dripping from my hand after grabbing a handful of diy \"glitter\".

<span class='reread'>well, at least it worked.
