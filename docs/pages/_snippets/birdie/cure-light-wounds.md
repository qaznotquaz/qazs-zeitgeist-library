the other day, i found myself falling again and, when i landed, it really hurt! my foot was broken <s>or something, i'm not really sure</s>. i sat there for a couple of minutes yelping and wailing at passing classmates before remembering i keep my supplies with me at all times! just a minute later and i was back on my feet, completely uninjured.

i'm sure we've all been injured before, and it's for this very reason that the 'cure light wounds' spell exists. helps you stay positive <s>:)</s>

<s>so, anyways...</s>  

this is how i cast it usually.

***ingredients:***  
\- 1 aloe vera leaf *(positive properties known even to mundane medicine)*  
\- 17 red flowers *(the deeper the red, the better. note, keep the stems but not the roots)*  
\- 1 cup rubbing alcohol *(sorry)*  
\- 2 cups fresh water *(for boiling)*  
\- 2 1/2 tsp lady lawless' positive seasoning *(<s>shut up it's not cheating, there's a reason she makes this stuff</s>)*  
\- sugar *(for taste)*  
\- 1 cinnamon stick *(for taste)*  
\- at least 1 cup fruit juice *(for filling empty volume in your bottle. sweeter tends to work better but use whatever makes you happy)*  
\- 2 tbsp sassafras root *(for taste - and hey, it's magical anyways)*  
\- continuous direct sunlight <span class='underline'><em>(orange rind works too but tastes significantly worse)  </em></span><span class='note'>-clever</span>

***equipment:***  
\- you're going to want to use a different setup than i use, trust me  
\- an extra bottle *(mistakes happen)*

*step 1:*  
boil aloe and sassafras **separately**. we'll get back to these in a bit.

*step 2:*  
grind red flowers to a fine powder, then add the powder to your potion bottle along with the alcohol.

*step 3:*  
drain water from aloe and mash aloe into a paste. add this to the alcohol solution.

*step 4:*  
add positive seasoning to sassafras solution. add sugar to taste *(it should feel like a little bit too much)*, shake well. add this to the alcohol solution.

*step 5:*  
fill remaining volume in bottle with fruit juice.

*step 6:*  
stir complete solution with cinnamon stick until not cloudy, then discard cinnamon stick *<s>(i usually just chew on it)</s>*.

corked, this technically keeps indefinitely - but, the taste worsens over time.
shake well before serving.

<span class='note'>I've taken the liberty to strike a number of unnecessary comments and instances of foolishness out of this recipe. You will be losing points for all of them because of a patent lack of professionalism.

<span class='reread'>wow, this is from FOREVER ago... it's been so long since i brewed my first potion. i love how epans couldn't find a single thing to actually dock me on besides 'professionalism'. what a joke. i've never seen a *wizard* who acts professional, much less an *alchemist*.

<span class='reread'>i think he just hated me like everyone else in the university does. not that i liked him all that much either.

<span class='reread'>hm. wonder where this came from anyways, it wasn't in my bag last night.
