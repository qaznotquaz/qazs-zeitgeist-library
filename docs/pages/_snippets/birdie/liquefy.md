have you ever wanted to drink a pig? no? me neither!

uh. here we go.

{% include collapsible.html title="you will need:" content="
***ingredients:***  
\- one (1) liter **ðŸœ‰** *(aqua vitae)*  
\- 0.5 liters pitcher-plant juice or similar *(if you use something else, make sure to proportion it based on strength)*  
\- at least two (2) gallons (7.57 liters) purest water *(how long can you hold your breath?)*  
\- reasonable lung capacity  
\- three (3) rat stomachs *(you need two and you'll mess up one)*  
\- a small item with sentimental value that you're unwilling to part with *(not something fragile or weak - it will be submerged. unless you make a mistake, you should not have to part with this.)*  
\- ten (10) grams mercury  
\- 0.5 tsp lady lawless' transmuting tincture *(would usually prefer the powder but we can't use that here)*

***a note about flavor***  
\- you will not want to ingest this. because we need to keep it as pure as we do, there is no room for even vanilla extract. my recommendation is to keep something overwhelming like *dried seaweed*, or a *whole pepper*, on your person. this **will not** be going into the extract.

---

***equipment:***  
\- i won't tell you which specific bottles and methods of yours to use but you will need a few special items  
\- a few small items you *are* willing to part with that don't melt at low temperatures *(i use copper coins. the exact item is irrelevant, though - these are not used in preparation directly)*  
\- a damp environment. if you're in a dry area, you will have to actively humidify your tools with pure water  
\- a rag *(make sure it can fit over the mouth of your target bottle)*  
\- an extra target bottle *(you know you're gonna break one)*  
\- a special jar

- **part 1:** the drowning jar.

*step 1:*  
take a deep breath and hold it - as though you might drown. do not exhale until **step 5**.

*step 2:*  
wrap up your **sentimental item** with the **rag** and place this into your *target bottle*.

*step 3:*  
begin channeling a small amount of **neutral energy** and an even smaller amount of **negative** through the **purest water** according to the *ceaseless hunger* pattern and slowly fill the **bottle** with it. continue pouring, even if overflowing, until you feel like you're about to pass out.  
***DO NOT POUR TOO FAST.*** *if you run out of water, you will have to empty the bottle, squeeze out the rag, get more water, and restart from step one.*

*step 4:*  
set the **bottle** down, remove the **rag** from it, and remove the **sentimental item** from the **rag**.

*step 5:*  
shift the target of your channeling to the **jar** and release your breath into it.

*step 6:*  
quickly cover the mouth of the **jar** with the **rag**, then seal the **jar** tightly. you can breathe now.  

if you passed out before reaching this step, that is your problem.

- **part 2:** acid melange

*step 7:*  
pour the **pitcher-plant juice** into a prepared container.

*step 8:*  
with caution, empty the contents of **two rat stomachs** into the same container. swirl the container until the texture is consistent.

*step 9:*  
while swirling, add the **transmuting tincture**.

*step 10:*  
still swirling, hold the **mercury** and **disposable items** in your hand over the container. let the mercury flow in as it melts and, as it does, channel **four parts neutral energy** and **one part negative energy** through it according to *the nameless dis-completion pattern*. you can stop channeling and discard the disposable items after all the mercury has flowed into the container.  
*pay attention to your other items while you do this - if they begin melting, you're channeling too much negative energy. similarly, if they aren't melting, you're not channeling enough negative energy. i still don't get where the sweet spot is supposed to be.*

---

- **part 3:** bottle.

*step 11:*  
empty the **target bottle**, which should've still been full of **purest water** until now, and fill it with the **acid melange**.

*step 13:*
