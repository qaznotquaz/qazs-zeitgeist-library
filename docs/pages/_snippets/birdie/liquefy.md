***ingredients:***  
\- one (1) liter **ðŸœ‰** *(aqua vitae)*  
\- 0.5 liters pitcher-plant juice or similar *(if you use something else, make sure to proportion it based on strength)*  
\- at least one (1) gallon (3.79 liters) purest water *(how long can you hold your breath?)*  
\- three (3) rat stomachs *(you need two and you'll mess up one)*  
\- a small item with sentimental value that you're unwilling to part with *(not something fragile or weak - it will be submerged. unless you make a mistake, you should not have to part with this.)*  
\- ten (10) grams mercury  
\- 0.5 tsp lady lawless' transmuting tincture *(would usually prefer the powder but we can't use that here)*

***a note about flavor***  
\- you will not want to ingest this. because we need to keep it as pure as we do, there is no room for even vanilla extract. my recommendation is to keep something overwhelming like *dried seaweed*, or a *whole pepper*, on your person. this **will not** be going into the extract.

***equipment:***  
\- i won't tell you which specific bottles and methods of yours to use but you will need a few special items  
\- a few small objects you *are* willing to part with *(i use copper coins. their composition is irrelevant - these are not used in preparation directly)*  
\- a damp environment. if you're in a dry area, you will have to actively humidify your tools with pure water  
\- a cloth  *(make sure it can fit over the mouth of your target bottle)*  
\- an extra target bottle *(you know you're gonna break one)*  
\- a special jar

take a deep breath and hold it - like you might drown. hold it as long as you can. move to step **2** for now, but refer back to steps **1b** and **1c** when you're about to pass out.

*1b:*  
take the jar begin channeling **four parts neutral** and **one part negative** energy into it according to your least favorite variation of the *ceaseless hunger pattern* while releasing your breath into the jar.  

*1c:*  
once the jar is filled, cover it with the specially prepared rag and then seal it.  
return to the step you were on.

*step 2:*  
wrap up your **sentimental item** with the rag and place this into your *target bottle*. slowly fill the bottle with **purest water**, and continue pouring un
