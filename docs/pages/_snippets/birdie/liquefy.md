have you ever wanted to drink a pig? no? me neither!

***ingredients:***  
\- one (1) liter **ðŸœ‰** *(aqua vitae)*  
\- 0.5 liters pitcher-plant juice or similar *(if you use something else, make sure to proportion it based on strength)*  
\- one (1) gallon (3.79 liters) purest water  
\- three (3) rat stomachs *(you need two and you'll mess up one)*  
\- a small object with sentimental value that you're unwilling to part with *(jewelery or paper should be just fine. unless you make a mistake, you should not have to part with this.)*  
\- ten (10) grams mercury  
\- 0.5 tsp lady lawless' transmuting tincture *(would usually prefer the powder but we can't use that here)*

***a note about flavor***  
\- you will not want to ingest this. because we need to keep it as pure as we do, there is no room for even vanilla extract. my recommendation is to keep something overwhelming like *dried seaweed*, or a *whole pepper*, on your person. this **will not** be going into the extract.

***equipment:***  
\- i won't tell you which specific bottles and methods of yours to use but you will need a few special items  
\- a few small objects you're willing to part with *(i use copper coins)*  
\- a damp environment. if you're in a dry area, you will have to actively humidify your tools with pure water.  
\- a wet cloth  *(make sure it can fit over the mouth of your target bottle)*  
\- an extra target bottle *(you know you're gonna break one)*  
\- a separate large glass bottle
