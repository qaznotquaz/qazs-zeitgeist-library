\- one (1) liter **ðŸœ‰** *(aqua vitae)*

\- three (3) rat stomachs *(you need two and you'll mess up one)*  
\- a small item with sentimental value that you're unwilling to part with *(not something fragile or weak - it will be submerged.)*  
\- ten (10) grams mercury *(frozen solid until needed)*  
\- 0.5 tsp lady lawless' transmuting tincture *(would usually prefer the powder, but we can't use that here)*

***a note about flavor***  
\- you will not want to ingest this. because we need to keep it as pure as we do, there is no room for even vanilla extract. my recommendation is to keep something overwhelming like *dried seaweed*, or a *whole pepper*, on your person. this **will not** be going into the extract.

---

***equipment: (i won't tell you which specific bottles and methods of yours to use but you will need a few special things)***  
\- a few small items you *explicitly don't care for* that don't naturally melt at low temperatures *(i use copper coins. the exact item is irrelevant, though - these are indicators, not ingredients)*  
\- a damp environment. if you're in a dry area, you will have to actively humidify your tools with pure water  
\- a rag *(make sure it can fit over the mouth of your target bottle)*  
\- an extra target bottle *(you know you're gonna break one)*  
\- a special jar

- **part 1:** the drowning jar.

*step 1:*  
take a deep breath and hold it - as though you might drown. do not exhale until **step 5**.

*step 2:*  
wrap up your **sentimental item** with the **rag** and place this into your *target bottle*.

*step 3:*  
begin channeling a small amount of **neutral energy** and an even smaller amount of **negative energy** through the **purest water** according to the *ceaseless hunger* pattern and slowly fill the **bottle** with it. continue pouring, even if overflowing, until you feel like you're about to pass out.  
***DO NOT POUR TOO FAST.*** *if you run out of water, you will have to empty the bottle, squeeze out the rag, get more water, and restart from step one.*

*step 4:*  
set the **bottle** down, remove the **rag** from it, and remove the **sentimental item** from the **rag**.

*step 5:*  
shift the target of your channeling to the **jar** and release your breath into it.

*step 6:*  
quickly cover the mouth of the **jar** with the **rag**, then seal the **jar** tightly. you can breathe now.  

if you passed out before reaching this step, that is your problem.

---

- **part 2:** acid melange

*step 7:*  
pour the **pitcher-plant juice** into a prepared container.

*step 8:*  
with caution, empty the contents of **two rat stomachs** into the same container. swirl the container until the texture is consistent.

*step 9:*  
while swirling, add the **transmuting tincture**.

*step 10:*  
still swirling, hold the **mercury** and **disposable items** in your hand over the container. *(don't worry about the frostburn, you'll be fine)*. let the mercury flow in as it melts and, as it does, channel **four parts neutral energy** and **one part negative energy** through it according to *the nameless dis-completion pattern*. you can stop channeling after all the mercury has flowed into the container, but hold on to those disposable items you used - we'll be watching them later.  
*pay attention to your other items while you do this - if they begin melting, you're channeling too much negative energy. similarly, if they aren't melting, you're not channeling enough negative energy. <span class='underline'>i still don't get where the sweet spot is supposed to be.</span>* <span class='note'>Just when they are beginning to soften in your hand.</span>

---

- **part 3:** bottle

*step 11:*  
empty the **target bottle**, which should've still been full of **purest water** until now, and fill it with the **acid melange**.

*step 12:*  
slowly fill the remaining space in the bottle with **aqua vitae** while swirling. as soon as the color shifts, cork the bottle.

kept moist, this extract should last the whole day an extract should last before becoming inert and *beginning to dissolve its bottle*. don't forget to discard this one if you don't use it!

{% include collapsible.html title="serving instructions" content="
you have a few options for preparing to drink this extract. what you *could* do is just chug it down, but you're likely to retch while channeling which - i shouldn't need to tell you - would be disastrous. so, this is where we want that **overwhelming flavor**. produce a **whole pepper** along with the extract and chew on it until the pain has filled your mouth. swallow that, then chug the extract down while channeling **neutral energy** according to *the nameless dis-completion pattern*. <span class='underline'>since you're an alchemist, you'll have to stay in contact with your target</span> as you unseal the **drowning jar** and begin the spell. unless you're draining your target into the jar, you don't need to worry too much about handling either particularly carefully at this point. <span class='note'>Good insight.</span>

if you *are* draining your target into the jar, then make sure to *hold* the object, and point the mouth of the jar *directly at* the target *(even if that means the jar turns upside-down!)*. the hunger should do the rest of the work - just make sure to right the bottle before ceasing channeling.

either way, you'll want to produce your disposable items once you have a free hand and hold on to them for the duration of the spell. if at any point they begin to melt, you need to stop channeling ***immediately***. you'll be next.

enjoy!

- *description*

we each did two trials on an **eight-pound block of lead**. once *without* draining it into a jar, and once *with*. most students had to resort to boro beads to complete both tests in a reasonable timeframe. i refused to. they didn't let me go til last. probably a good call, in retrospect.

---

- *first trial*

preparation and imbibing of this extract both went fairly normally. the lead melted into a puddle in my hand but stayed cold, as expected. i paced around the room slowly, focusing on my channel.  
at the *40-second mark*, i felt my indicators begin softening.  
at the *50-second mark*, i realized my indicators were leaking from my hand.  
at the *<span class='underline'>55-second</span>* *mark*, i ceased and collected my coin-puddles up from the floor.  
<span class='note'>Impressive channel duration.</span>

after that, i <s>took a moment to clear my head.</s> <span class='note'>-3 points: Failure to document loss of consciousness. (And, -5: Loss of consciousness)</span>

---

- *second trial*

personally, i think the second trial went swimmingly. my classmates wouldn't tell you as such. preparation went just fine, but my throat <s>tried to scream</s> <span class='note'>You screamed at full volume and tore your vocal cords.</span> while i was imbibing the extract. <span class='underline'>i held the channel together</span> <span class='note'>+10 points</span>, but my voice was shot. the lead melted, again, as expected. the jar swallowed it up instantly, as expected. i didn't cease my channel as expected, though.

i held it out and continued pacing.  
at the *30-second mark*, the class fell silent.  
at the *41-second mark*, i surveyed my classmates and grinned.  
at the *52-second mark*, i <span class='underline'>brought the jar of lead to my lips, slowly drinking it down.</span> <span class='note'>-5 points: Failure to follow basic safety procedures</span>

<span class='underline'>woke up in my bed at the infirmary.</span> <span class='note'>-5 points: Loss of consciousness</span>

and, honestly? the taste wasn't particularly interesting.

<span class='note'>The average student had to hold their breath for about a minute - or, at most, two. You, on the other hand, spent seven minutes and thirty-four seconds doing this on your first extract, and eight minutes flat on your second. Not only did you distract the class with the visual spectacle of it, you also went through our entire on-hand storage of purest water. We made sure you were supplied with enough to complete your preparations, of course, but only so that the students could complete theirs.

<span class='note'>More importantly, however, you failed to discuss this anomaly in your paper at any point. This failure is what you're being marked off for here.

<span class='note'>-2: Minor formatting errors.  
<span class='note'>-2: Blatant falsehood.

<span class='note'>We had to scrape up drops of your hand from the floor for reincorporation, and none of the infirmary staff enjoyed having to figure out how to remove an 8-lb block of lead from your intestines. Your vocal cords were only cured because of the sheer amount of positive energy they spent retrieving that lead.

<span class='note'>Regarding your comment about the flavor of the lead... A liquefied object is not meant to be ingested. In the case that it is, the drinker is encouraged to cough up the liquid before it runs through the system for too long. Leaving it in tends to cause... disastrous side effects.

<span class='note'>Such as the reconstitution of eight pounds of sharp-edged lead in the upper intestinal tract and stomach region.

{% include collapsible.html title="<span class='reread'>my reread notes</span>" content="
<span class='reread'>i'm concerned about this. just like the last one, i don't remember learning this spell. i don't even have enough Authority to cast this spell normally right now, let alone enough to channel it for a whole minute. invisibility is draining enough, and that only has *one* channel in its preparation!

...i don't think the university only took my memories. i don't know how, but they must have taken my Authority when i left too.

<span class='reread'>y'know what else is chilling about this? i did this earlier today. i used my ***mad genius*** and this is the spell that resulted. or at least, i think so. it was horrific. it was more than it should be, even considering the fact that i'm pushing myself a step higher than i should.

<span class='reread'>i melted a person.

<span class='reread'>she was evil and deserved to die, i think, but that does not change the fact that i *liquefied her entire body*. i drank the extract, walked up to her, and grabbed her face.
<span class='reread'>and melted her.
<span class='reread'>not, like, ten pounds of her or whatever -  

<span class='reread'>*all of her*.

<span class='reread'>what's worse? this spell shouldn't be able to affect living beings in the first place. not even partially. it <s>couldn't</s> ***no,*** it <s>shouldn't</s> ***no,*** it *can't*.  
 <span class='reread'>it *can't do that*. that's not how this spell even *works*. but it did. or, *something* did.

<span class='reread'>that's not even mentioning the *worst* worse part: she's still liquid. it's been hours. i'm almost ready to sleep. the spell should've worn off by now. i stopped channeling barely moments after she drained into the jar, but she remained dis-completed.

<span class='reread'>i think it's permanent. i hope it is, anyways.

<span class='reread'>p.s., i really don't get why dr mayakovski seems so much different on this assignment than the last one. handwriting, grading, tone, the whole works... what *happened?*
