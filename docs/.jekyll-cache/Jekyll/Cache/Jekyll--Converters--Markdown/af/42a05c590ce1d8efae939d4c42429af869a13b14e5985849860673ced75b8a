<p>You find yourself sitting at a desk with an ancient fountain pen in hand. It could also be a typewriter, a keyboard, a pencil… anything you may feel like using to write out your thoughts on some occasion or another. Today though, like most days, it’s your fountain pen. You place the tip of the pen to the paper, and your reality abruptly contradicts itself - you’re already writing. As this twist in your perception washes over you, you find myself acutely aware of the sensations coursing through me as I write. I feel the <strong><em>ink</em></strong> filling my veins again. It moves unnaturally, draining first from the center of my skull. It creeps down the back of my neck, crawling cold and quiet beneath my skin. It trickles down my spine for a distance before making its way to the center of my chest. I feel it, cold and bracing, filling my heart. The pain anchors me to the spot, keeping me here, lost in the <strong><em>ink</em></strong>. My veins carry it as it courses through me, and every sensation is impossibly visceral. After the <strong><em>ink</em></strong> rests in my heart for several beats, it begins to travel towards my hand, my pen. Where it moves in my arm, I see <strong><em>ink-dark</em></strong> veins pulsing underneath my skin. The words continue to flow. The veins creep and crawl down my shoulder, my forearm, my wrist, pulsing in time with my heavy heart. The veins crawl and twist up my hand, my fingers, my fingertips, bulging as though enraged. Where the <strong><em>ink</em></strong> reaches my fingertips, I feel the sharpest pain of all. I’m never sure, though, whether it’s that wound which hurts the most, or the biting sense of loss as the thoughts leave me and take a concrete form, never to change again. I know that they must leave me. I know, too, that I will be glad once they’re gone, once they’re safe. It is a wonder, though, that I can ever read these back, what with the messy <strong><em>ink-</em></strong> and tear-stains.</p>

<p>My headache sharpens. I pause to collect myself.</p>
