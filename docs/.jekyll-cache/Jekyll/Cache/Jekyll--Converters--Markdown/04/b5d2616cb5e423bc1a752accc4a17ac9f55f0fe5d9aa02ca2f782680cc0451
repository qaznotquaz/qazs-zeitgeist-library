I"¶<p>hallowed halls, these once were. are? am? were?</p>

<p>i donâ€™t think theyâ€™re meant to look like this. the clean-cut edges of the marble are shaven down, and the pieces barely fit together. the faces are not smooth or reflective, as they likely should be. instead, they are soft and gently rough.</p>

<p>i donâ€™t think the pillars are supposed to be arranged on the floor, in pieces, like they are. the ceiling certainly stands, somehow, staying definitely sturdy amidst the strewn, useless structural supports. less lucky, however, is the floor.</p>

<p>pieces of it are broken apart - some having crumbled down into sinkholes, but many others having curiously fallen upwards, to cover up various faces and names engraved on the surfaces above my head. theyâ€™re beautifully carved, but most details have long since vanished.</p>

<p>i tried to read one. i found a path to the ceiling by way of clambering up broken chunks of marble, many of which float in place. once i placed my feet against the ceiling, i found it to be solid below me. i stood, cautiously, and surveyed the carvings. i made sure not to trample any out of respect for the dead, but i really donâ€™t think they deserve it.</p>
