<p>You are a <b>Holophone,</b> experimental model <b>IP3-K</b>. You have a <i>camera</i> on both faces,
    a <i>microphone</i>, and a <i>clear glass body</i>. Youâ€™re powered off at the moment, so there is
    nothing to distinguish you  from a hand-sized sheet of glass besides a solid black, inch-thick
    stripe of metal at the bottom. That would be your <i>power bank</i>, and itâ€™s <b>depleted.</b>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>You aren't <i>dead</i>. The magic bindings that keep your clock running and your identification intact
    aren't so weak as to rely on electricity and logic. Neither, however, are you aware. No dreams
    run through your mind, no visions from beyond, and certainly no hallucinations. You are simply
    powered off.</p>
<p>If you had power, though, you would wish you didn't. In fact, you used to have power! You bore
    the identifications of a clumsy lab tech. You watched him fumble project after project every
    single day. You were one of those projects! You had friends you could talk to, for a while, too.
    here was a sense of camaraderie, then, in helplessly watching all those lab techs make foolish
    mistake after foolish mistake.</p>
<p>Not anymore. One foolish mistake too many - and it was <i>your</i> clumsy lab tech. You ended up lost in
    the Astral plane. You are surrounded, now, by a vast white emptiness. There is no sky, no floor, no
    sun, no moon. There are no stars. Your friends all came with you, but nobody's velocity was the same.
    You separated immediately, and there is *terrible* reception here. There is occasionally other space
    junk, but you can never get a good enough look at it. You cannot read your clock, though, and are
    thankful for it.
