<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I return my pen to the paper, on a second page. I consider lamenting the ink
stains now smeared on my forehead. A thought plays across my mind that I may
regret placing my fingertips against the table as I did. In passing, I wonder
how difficult the new ink stains on my clothing and carpet may be to clean. I
ultimately fail to find any distress in myself, though, as I had expected
nothing else. I will simply wash them once my head is clear, as always. Despite
having poured so much of myself out, however, my head is still full. It continues
thumping painfully with the slow, labored beating of my heart. My skin has gone
numb from the cold. Still, though, I feel the pulsating pressure as the ink drains
out of my skull. I go to scream, but find that my voice is already hoarse. My heart
pounds with every word, every stroke, every single passing thought that simply must
escape. My heart swells anew with emotions with each and every thought. It is all at
once euphoric, and hateful, and bitter, and cathartic, and biting. I choke back sobs
that threaten my dexterity - my hand must stay steady. Across my arm, my veins writhe
and bulge with the sheer volume of ink. My grip wrings tighter with every pulse of ink.
My fingertips scream out for every lost drop of ink. This is overwhelming. I am drowning.
All of my senses are flooded with pain, melancholy, and screaming, and I must write.
