I"<p>I return my pen to the paper, on a second page. I consider lamenting the <strong><em>ink</em></strong> stains now smeared on my forehead. A thought plays across my mind that I may regret placing my fingertips against the table as I did. In passing, I wonder how difficult the new <strong><em>ink</em></strong> stains on my clothing and carpet may be to clean. I ultimately fail to find any distress in myself, though, as I had expected nothing else. I will simply wash them once my head is clear, as always. Despite having poured so much of myself out, however, my head is still full. It continues thumping painfully with the slow, labored beating of my heart. My skin has gone numb from the cold. Still, though, I feel the pulsating pressure as the <strong><em>ink</em></strong> drains out of my skull. I go to scream, but find that my voice is already hoarse. My heart pounds with every word, every stroke, every single passing thought that simply must escape. My heart swells anew with emotions with each and every thought. It is all at once euphoric, and hateful, and bitter, and cathartic, and biting. I choke back sobs that threaten my dexterity - my hand must stay steady. Across my arm, my veins writhe and bulge with the sheer volume of <strong><em>ink</em></strong>. My grip wrings tighter with every pulse of <strong><em>ink</em></strong>. My fingertips scream out for every lost drop of <strong><em>ink</em></strong>. This is overwhelming. I am drowning. All of my senses are flooded with pain, melancholy, and screaming, and I must write.</p>
