*falling asleep.*

tumbling, feel the rushing air, *close my eyes.* just for a second.

falling faster, faster still. can't see the ground, can't see the sky. just relax, *fall asleep.*

*fall asleep.*

gentle whispers, just keep falling. *close my eyes* again, when did they open? why am I awake? my grip is tight on my paper and pen, lest I drop them.

I feel the wind play through my hair as I fall asleep. my clothing flaps gently as I fall faster. tumbling, rolling - take my time. *just fall asleep.*

*plummet.*

faster again, my thoughts drift farther. gentle humming, falling asleep. holding tight to my diary. hearing nothing but wind. seeing nothing but air. *feel empty, open, gentle, quiet.*

*plummet, asleep.*

{% include collapsible.html content="I know I hit the ground, but I don't know when. I don't know where, either. somewhere new, of course, but it's just as apocalyptic as the rest.
                                     
my right arm broke, apparently. when I landed. it doesn't hurt much, just a dull roar when I try to move it too far. I don't think I'll need to worry about it.
                                     
I must've been falling for hours. well, I'm wide awake now." %}
